A minimal **P**[HP] [M]**VC** framework using well-tried concepts in PHP.  


## Features

Beside controllers, an event dispatcher and a PHP two step view including view helpers and extensions PVC supports the following standards:

- PSR-7 HTTP message implementation
- PSR-15 HTTP server-side middlewares
- PSR-17 HTTP factories implementation 

Others are planned.


## Prerequisites

- PHP 7.2
- Composer


## Installation

Composer is your friend.

    $ composer create-project tebe/pvc myproject


## Running

    $ cd myproject/example/public
    $ php -S localhost:9999

Start your web browser and open <http://localhost:9999>


### Middlewares

The example is using some middlewares.

For the BasicAuth middleware the Login details are:

    Username: user
    Password: pass 

You're ready to go!


## Testing & Code quality

We've integrated several scripts to ensure code quality.

    # Using PHPUnit
    $ composer phpunit

    # Using PHP-Codesniffer
    $ composer phpcs
    
    # Fixing Codesniffer issues
    $ composer phpcbf
    
    # Using both together
    $ composer test


## Continuous Integration

PVC is using [Travis](<https://travis-ci.org/tbreuss/pvc>) for it's Continuous Integration.
